Because in application development your collection of urls can feel like a sea of Uri's which are not easily testable, I invented Umi.ApplicationUri.

Umi is a lightweight approach for using urls in your application but register them collectively so they can be tested and retrieved with ease.

If you instantiate not just an Uri or string for your application but an ApplicationUri then it will be picked up by Umi.
Umi can list and test them. This is handy for manual or alerting purposes

Umi is a Japanese girl name, meaning sea ;)
